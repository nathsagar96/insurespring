# InsureSpring

## Project Description

The Insure Spring is a Spring Boot application designed for efficiently managing clients, policies, and
claims. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on these entities while ensuring data integrity, validation, and a
seamless API experience. The application uses Spring Boot 3, Java 21, and modern Spring practices, including features
like Java Records for DTOs, global exception handling, and input validation.

## Features

- **Client Management**: Add, update, view, and delete client information.
- **Policy Management**: Manage insurance policies, including coverage amounts, policy types, and premium details.
- **Claims Management**: File and track insurance claims with status updates.
- **Input Validation**: Automatic validation of user inputs using Spring's validation annotations.
- **Exception Handling**: Centralized and consistent exception handling across the application.
- **RESTful APIs**: Well-structured and documented REST APIs for interaction with clients, policies, and claims.

## Project Structure
